## Towers of Hanoi

  The classic algorithm problem, with 3 pegs and a innumerable amount of rings, that one must transfer from one peg to the last one, resulting in a tower of rings in the same order as they started. This uses recursive functions to execute the puzzle. It will complete the puzzle, now matter how many rings are used.
  
## User Submussion Form

  A simple submission form using JSP, that takes input and submits it to a confirmation page. This was my first foray into using Java with the web.
  
## Hibernate Tutorial

  A tutorial that I completed to make a CRUD app using Hibernate. The sql scripts and starter files folder has the files to recreate the databse used in the application. The app will enter, create, read, update, and delete hard coded entities into the databse.

## Password Validation

  This application is a simple exercise in code testing using JUnit. I created a series of tests and compiled them into a suite to test a set of functions that would validate various parts of a password. When the suite is run, it will run the tests against the functions with the input that is given, and prove true or false.
